# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

## Overview

The "Etch-a-Sketch" project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course, designed as a web-based drawing application that allows users to draw by hovering over a grid with a customizable size. This project demonstrates key skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic styling.

## Demonstrated Skills

- **HTML Structure**: Used semantic HTML elements such as `<main>`, along with proper meta tags and document structure.
- **CSS Styling**: Styled the grid layout, button interactions, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Implemented dynamic grid creation, random color generation, and opacity scaling on hover.
- **Event Handling**: Managed user interactions such as adjusting grid size and handling mouse hover effects over grid cells.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Generated and updated grid cells dynamically through JavaScript.
